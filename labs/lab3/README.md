# Lab 3

*Assigned: sometime*

*Due: Sometime (just before class)*


The goal of this lab is for you to play around with data parsing and extraction tools -- specifically low-level  tools like sed and awk, and high-level tools like data wrangler.

1. Check out the goby dataset
2. use sed/awk to extract out the descriptions of the events, the tags, and the hours
3. what's the most popular 1/2-grams?
4. what are the most popular hours?  for partying?
5. now use wrangler to extract the structured content.  What was easy to do?  What was difficult?

1. Now run some queries on the extracted text to prove you've done it.
