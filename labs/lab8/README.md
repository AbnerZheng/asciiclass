*Assigned: Nov 5, 2013*

The goal of this lab is for you to play with creating web-based

## Datasets

In this lab, you will use a dataset of all taxi cab pickups in Boston proper. 

[Download the dataset here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mitbigdata/datasets/pickups_train.csv.gz)

In the lab directory is also a file of interesting locations in boston.


### Questions

Construct a visualization that provides insight about the ebb and flow of 
taxi rides through the interesting locations in Boston.

* What is the message in your visualization and what techniques did you use to illustrate it?
* If you used interaction or animation, how does it facilitate the user's understanding?
* What format is the data that is used by the visualization?  Is it the raw data or computed summaries?

# Submission Instructions

Put your visualization and answer to the questions somewhere on the
internet where we can access.  [http://bl.ocks.org/](http://bl.ocks.org/)
is a nice place if you don't want to host yourself.
